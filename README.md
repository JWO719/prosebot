## Usage

This Probot App listens for changes to Markdown files (`.md`) or text files (`.txt`) and runs various checks against them to provide feedback on the English. Currently, the app checks for spelling, prose and inclusive verbiage.

### Installation

~Visit [the installation page](https://github.com/apps/write-good-app) and install the GitHub App on your repositories.~ COMING :soon:

### Configuration

There are currently three providers that the app uses to test your text. These can each be disabled, and are all enabled by default. To disable a provider, add a `.github/write-good.yml` file to your repository and set the provider to `false`:

```yaml
# .github/write-good.yml
writeGood: true
alex: true
spellchecker: true
```

### Credits

This Probot App is mostly a wrapper around existing open source libraries. The majority of the work is done by those, and they deserve a ton of thanks:

* [`write-good`](https://github.com/btford/write-good)
* [`alex`](https://github.com/get-alex/alex)
* [`node-spellchecker`](https://github.com/atom/node-spellchecker)
